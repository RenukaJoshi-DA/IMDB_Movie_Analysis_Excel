**Description:**
  The IMDb Movie Analysis project aims to explore and analyze a comprehensive dataset of movies available on the IMDb platform. Through in-depth data analysis using Excel, Data Visualization and Statistics techniques this project seeks to extract valuable insights and trends that contribute to a movie's success.
  The major goal of this project is to identify key factors that contribute to a movie's success measured by it's IMDb ratings. Understanding these factors can help movie directors, producers and investors make data driven decisions.

**Dataset Overview:**
The key columns in the dataset includes:
1. movie_title : The name of the movie.
2. imdb_score : The average rating given by users on IMDb.
3. genres : The category or categories the movie belongs to (e.g. Action, Drama, Comedy, etc).
4. duration : The length of the movie in minutes.
5. language : The primary language in which the movie was released.
6. country : The primary region where the movie was released.
7. director_name : The name of the director responsible for the movie.
8. budget : The estimated production budget in USD.
9. gross : The total revenue generated by the movie worldwide.

**Analysis Tasks:**
1. Movie genre analysis : Determine the most common genres of movies in the dataset. Then, for each genre, calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation) of the IMDB scores.
2. Movie duration analysis : Analyze the distribution of movie durations and identify the relationship between movie duration and IMDB score.
3. Language analysis : Determine the most common languages used in movies and analyze their impact on the IMDB score using descriptive statistics.
4. Director analysis : Identify the top directors based on their average IMDB score and analyze their contribution to the success of movies using percentile calculations.
5. Budget analysis : Analyze the correlation between movie budgets and gross earnings, and identify the movies with the highest profit margin.

- Ideal movie duration lies between 90-120 minutes; excessively long or short films tend to receive lower ratings.
- The most common languages used in the movies are English, French, Spanish, Mandarin and German. But non-english films exhibit greater variability.
